  Sets the baud rate, receive FIFO depth, transmit/receice time out, parity,

  @param ReveiveFifoDepth   The requested depth of the FIFO on the receive side of the
                            serial interface. A ReceiveFifoDepth value of 0 will use
                            the device's default FIFO depth.

                            value of DefaultStopBits will use the device's default number of
                            stop bits.
